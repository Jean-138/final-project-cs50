# Final Project CS50


This project is the final assignment for the CS50 course (2025 edition). The goal was to develop a simple Python program that demonstrates my understanding of basic programming concepts learned throughout the course.

The main file `main.py` contains the program code. It prompts the user to input a task and then confirms the task was added, simulating a basic task manager.

I chose Python for its simplicity and readability, which made it easier to demonstrate the core concepts.

Files included in this repository:

- `todo.py` — The Python script with the project code.
- `tarefas.txt` — The text file where tasks are saved.
- `README.md` — This file explaining the project and providing the video demo link.

I made sure to keep the code simple and clear to reflect the learning objectives of the course.
